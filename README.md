# Mp3-Copier
This program is designed for exporting the songs from a folder formatted like an osu! songs folder. It reads metadata from the beatmap file then applies it to the copied song file.

It also has a secondary function: search for files of a given type within a folder and all subfolders.













Do NOT use this program to distribute copyright-protected music.
